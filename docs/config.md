# Configuring the emulator

There are a number of configuration options that can be set on the emulator.

- Common Options

  - PORT (number)
    - The local port on which the emulator listens
    - `Default: 3978 (debugger) / 80 (Docker)`
  - WEBHOOK_URL (URL)
    - The URL of your webhook service (by default, set to the emulator built-in implementation)
    - `Default: http://localhost:[PORT]/webhook`
  - LANDING_PAGE_URL (URL)
    - The URL of your landing page (by default, set to the emulator built-in implementation)
    - `Default: http://localhost:[PORT]/landing.html`
  - SKIP_DATA_LOAD (boolean)
    - Tell the emulator not to load any existing data file on startup. This value is only used during startup. Useful for debugging.
    - `Default: false`

  - OPERATION_TIMEOUT
    - Operations do not happen immediately. This value defines the time between an operation being submitted and it being completed.

All options can be passed as environment variables. Some can be configured in UI on the `Config` page of the emulator.

## Configuration Examples

### Configuring when running locally or in VS Code

You can set environment variables by [creating a .env file](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-read-environment-variables-from-nodejs/) in the root folder. Example .env file that sets `PORT`, `LANDING_PAGE_URL` and `SKIP_DATA_LOAD`

```text
PORT=80
LANDING_PAGE_URL='http://localhost:3000/landing.html'
SKIP_DATA_LOAD=TRUE
```

### Configuring Docker images

You can either set environment variables directly in the `docker run` command or pass values exported from the shell. For options related to using environment variables with docker run, see the [relevant Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#-set-environment-variables--e---env---env-file). For example:

1. Run the emulator setting the `LANDING_PAGE_URL`

   ```bash
   docker run -d \
    -p '8080:80' \
    -e LANDING_PAGE_URL='https://www.fourthcoffee.com/landing.html' \
    'marketplace-api-emulator'
   ```

1. Run the emulator setting the `WEBHOOK_URL` and `OPERATION_TIMEOUT`

   ```bash  
   export WEBHOOK_URL='https://www.fourthcoffee.com/webhook'
   export OPERATION_TIMEOUT='PT1M'

   docker run -d \
    -p '8080:80' \
    -e 'WEBHOOK_URL' \
    -e 'OPERATION_TIMEOUT' \
    'marketplace-api-emulator'
   ```
